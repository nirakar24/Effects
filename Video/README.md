# Text and Video Toggle Effect

This README provides instructions on how to create a simple hover effect using HTML and CSS to toggle between a text div and a video div. When a user hovers over a container, the text content will fade out, and the video will fade in.

## Demo

To see the effect in action, you can check out this [demo](#). In this demo, we have a container that displays text content by default, and when you hover over it, the text fades out, and a video becomes visible.

## Implementation

### 1. HTML Structure

Your HTML structure should include a container (e.g., `video_container`) with two child divs (e.g., `text` and `video`). Here's an example:

```html
<div class="video_container">
    <div class="text">
        <!-- Your text content goes here -->
    </div>
    <div class="video">
        <!-- Your video content goes here -->
    </div>
</div>
